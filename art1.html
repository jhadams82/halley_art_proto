  <h3>Painting Title</h3>
  <h4>Oil on canvas, 30"x12"</h4>
  <p>This painting was made with paint of many colors with an abstracted idea of some physical object in mind.  
  If you think it might give you pleasure to hang on your wall, please use the website to buy it and I will 
  send it to you.  I will do this, of course, only if you give me money first.</p>
